# Installing CLIs

The demos included in this repository require the use of the following Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools to install and configure some of the projects that we are using: 

- Install the `vcluster` CLI to connect to the cluster: [https://www.vcluster.com/docs/getting-started/setup](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/getting-started/setup)
- Install the `argocd` CLI [https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/)
- Install the Knative Functions `func` CLI: [https://knative.dev/docs/functions/install-func/](https://knative.dev/docs/functions/install-func/)
